Documentation is available at [docs.atomazu.org](https://docs.atomazu.org).

To use this configuration, you can clone/fork the repo and add your host to `hosts/`.

**Note:** This configuration currently doesn't support enabling just 1 or 2 modules while leaving the rest disabledâ€”although this is planned. Right now it configures the bootloader, stylix, locale, and more, with no way to disable this behavior.

For more examples you may look at the existing configurations in `hosts/`.
